Basic Syntax\n\nYou can write python code using any plain text editor. Python script files have the extention **.py** \n\nYou do not need to compile python script, you can simply run it from your command-line interface using the command\n\n```python filename.py```\n\nThe python interpreter will then execute the script line by line, and if there are errors in your code, execution will stop with a helpful error message. \n\nLet's try to run a Hello World script in python\n\n","metadata":{"id":"oJOON-Le1lhX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":" print(\"Hello World\")","metadata":{"id":"IF86-cPw1atK","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-23T06:08:05.480827Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-23T06:08:05.482152Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-23T06:08:05.511164Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-23T06:08:05.482005Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-23T06:08:05.509888Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Hello World\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"id":"Z4pPLfDnaBt9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"```print``` is a built-in function that simply prints the argument, followed by a new-line character.

Lists\n\nLists are the simplest data structure in python. They are somewhat similar to arrays, but lists can have elements of different types. \n\nYou can create a list by specifying items within square brackets [ ] separated by commas ,\n\n```list1 = ['this', 'is' , 'my', 'list', 1, 2, 3]```\n\nYou can access individual list elements by specifying the list name and the index (starting with 0) within square brackets.

For example, \n\n```del list1[2]```\n\nYou can reverse the order of the elements using the method ```reverse()```.

Tuples\n\nTuples are similar to lists, but they cannot be updated after being assigned. So you can think of them as read-only lists.

Dictionaries\n\nPython dictionaries are similar to hash tables. They consist of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are specified using curly braces { }, and elements can be accessed and modified by specifying the key within square brackets [key]\n\nFor example,\n\n```\nd1 = {} \nd1['key1'] = 'value1'\nd1['key2'] = 'value2'\n```\n\nYou can list the keys of a dictionary using the methid ```.keys()```\n\nFor example, in the following code block, we will create a dictionary for words and their part-of-speech (noun, verb, or adjective). \n\n\n","metadata":{"id":"19iCNZU5HEs9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"d1 = {}\nd1['happy'] = 'adj'\nd1['sad'] = 'adj'\nd1['holiday'] = 'noun'\nd1['cat'] = 'noun'\nd1['go'] = 'verb'\nd1['consider'] = 'verb'\n\n#print the dictionary\nprint(d1) \n\n#access a specific element in the dictionary\nprint('cat is a ' + d1['cat'])\n\n#check if a key exists in a dictionary\nprint('happy' in d1)\n\n#delete an element of a dictionary\ndel d1['happy']\n\n#get the keys of the dictionary\nprint(d1.keys())","metadata":{"id":"Gh0kiJN7IuXV"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##6. Operators\n\nArithmetic operators in python are similar to Java. We have addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division(/) and mod (%). You can also use compound operators like += \n\nRelational operators for comparing vlues are also similar to Java (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=). \n\nLogical operators are as follows: \n\n* Logical AND: ```and```\n* Logical OR  :   ```or ```\n* Logical NOT: ```not```\n\nThere are also membership operators (```in```, ```not in```) to check if an element exists in a list\n\n## 7. Conditional Statements\n\n ```if``` statements in python consist of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements. The boolean expression has to be terminated with a colon :\n\nNote that unlike Java, we do not specify blocks using braces. Instead, all statements within a block should have the same indentation\n\n\n","metadata":{"id":"VDNRPj56Voqq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"a = 0\nb = 10\n\nif a < b and a > 0:\n  print(\"first condition is true\")\nelif a < b:\n  print(\"second condition is true\")\n  print(\"This is another statement in the same block\")\nelse:\n  print(\"false\")\n  print(\"this statement is part of the else block\")\nprint(\"Bye\") #this statement will be executed no matter what\n","metadata":{"id":"JIU3mxb5XPZu"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##8.
